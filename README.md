# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Robert Xu**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Environmental Technology**. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create my website.

My blogs are basically a journal on what I have been learning throughout the year. My freedom project shows everybody of some existing technology that benefits the environment as well as future technologies that will help the environment. The blogs shows everyone what I learned, how I learned and processed, and how I used it in my website.

There are both positive and negative impacts on society. For social, some existing technologies impacts individuals but not really relationships or culture. Like the Kinefox tracking device can be used in the future on pets to know their location. Most of the technologies have positive impacts on the environment. Some help reduce the negative impacts on the environment like CCS, but using those machines also cause pollution. Some are related to jobs because Olio and CCS need workers for it to work. Ecosia impacts the world positively and globally because they plant trees all around the globe with the help of locals and people using Ecosia. And Solar glass would affect infrastructure because the glass in tall building could get replaced and it would benefit the environment and people positively because electricity is being produced.

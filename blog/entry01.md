## Context on my topic
The topic I chose for was Environment because from a young age I liked to learn about animals and I still do. That interest in animals stayed and I want to help the environment so we can coexist better. I want to create technologies to help improve and protect the environment. I did consider topics like Chemistry and Oil/Energy/Solar/Greentech but I felt like I wouldn't be helping animals or people if I chose chemistry and I can cover and talk about Greentech if I do environment. The articles ["5 Technologies That Help The Environment & How Electronic Forms Preserve The Planetâ€™s Wellbeing"](https://www.doforms.com/technologies-that-help-environment/) amd ["Green technologies and sustainability: A new trend"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949736123000015#:~:text=Green%20energy%20technologies,and%20hydrogen%2D%20powered%20vehicles%20solution) are examples of informative websites that I found when I was researching environment technology and they both talk about technologies that help the environment. And researching about environmental technologies made me learn more on how to help the environment so I can teach others protecting the environment.  

## Engineering Design Process
Since this is my first blog, I am at the beginning and so I start at ***defining the problem***. There are major environmental issues and they include Global Warming and Climate Change, Water Pollution and Ocean Acidification, and Loss of Biodiversty. What I want to continue researching is how to bring back biodiversty to the environment and try to learn how to help solve Water Pollution and Ocean Acidification. 
## Skills

### Attention to detail
When I started doing this blog, it made me more focused on paying attention to detail. For example as I was writing these sentences, I caught many errors in my writing. Some errors that I wrote were ***I did considere topics like*** and ***I was researching environemt technology*** and many more. Which is why it is important to reread the code because rereading helped me catch some grammar mistakes.
### How to Google/Read
A skill I am developing is learning when to stop. A reason why this was important is when I read books or articles, if I get interested in it I would want to read the whole thing. But if I kept doing that, I wouldn't be focused and I will zone out and really be focused in what I was reading. An example of this happening is in LIT OF THE MODERN WORLD class, the teachers assigned us to read a certain amount of pages in our books, but since I was hooked to the book and zoned out I forgot to do my classwork.
### Embracing Failure
When I tried to put links into the sentences, I couldn't figure out how to do it. I remembered that I needed to put brackets and parentheses for linking to a sentence. So I put parentheses first and brackets second because I thought it the link goes first then writing the sentence/title goes second. But when I previewed I saw the link in blue so I knew I made a mistake. I was stuck on this but realized that I never tried the opposite so I tried flipping it and now there are two clickable links in the beginning.

## Context on my topic
The topic I chose for was Environment because from a young age I liked to learn about animals and I still do. That interest in animals stayed and I want to help the environment so we can coexist better. I want to create technologies to help improve and protect the environment. I did considere topics like Chemistry and Oil/Energy/Solar/Greentech but I felt like I wouldn't be helping animals or people if I chose chemistry and I can cover Greentech if I do environment. The articles ["5 Technologies That Help The Environment & How Electronic Forms Preserve The Planetâ€™s Wellbeing"](https://www.doforms.com/technologies-that-help-environment/) amd ["Green technologies and sustainability: A new trend"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949736123000015#:~:text=Green%20energy%20technologies,and%20hydrogen%2D%20powered%20vehicles%20solution) is a website  I found when I was researching environemt technology and it is really interesting and really informative.

### Context
In my first blog I wrote about why I chose the topic ***environment*** and I started to define the problem. In this blog I will be researching and possibly starting to brainstorm possible solutions to help combat *major environmental issues* like ***climate change*** and ***the loss of biodiversity***.

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
How I started was I went on a new tab and searched ***technologies and gadgets that help the environment***. Instantly, the first website I found showed me [14 technolgies people came up with to help the environment.](https://ecofriend.org/14-ways-technology-can-help-the-environment/#:~:text=Existing%20technology%20such%20as%20GPS,to%20prevent%20human%2Danimal%20conflicts.) Reading about the technologies that we have already created impressed me and I want to spread awareness to these technolgies so people can use them. After that I searched ***apps that help the environment*** and I found [a website](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/use-cnet-shopping-to-seek-out-the-best-deals/) that talked about Ecosia. 

#### Ecosia
*Ecosia* is an app or an extension for chrome. In an article it said that ["Ecosia uses the profits (from ads) that it makes from your searches to plant trees."](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/use-cnet-shopping-to-seek-out-the-best-deals/) Also when the Australian wildfires happened in 2020, They planted 100+ different trees species in Australia to help increase rainfall, lower temperatures, clean the air, and creating new habitats for the wildlife there. And Ecosia works around the world, and they publish monthly financial reports for accountability. Which shows the people using Ecosia that them using Ecosia is helping the world and that they aren't using the money for themselves. And Ecosia is downloadable on phones, it is an app for iOS and Android. In the present, Ecosia almost planted 200 million trees.

#### Carbon capture and storage
Since Carbon dioxide is contributing to climate change and global warming, scientists researched and created a way to catch the carbon in the atmosphere and storing it. They trap the carbon in rock formations thousands of feet underground, where eventually it will solidify and turn into a rock. They first did the CO2 capture in Switzerland and now Canada and US are also developing plants to do the same. But there are some major drawbacks to this technology, [first](https://blog.verde.ag/en/carbon-capture-and-storage-pros-cons/#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20carbon%20capture%20and,environmental%20risks%2C%20and%20limited%20scale.) a major drawback of using carbon capture and storage (CCS) is how expensive it is. And using this technology uses a ton on energy. Also there are potential environmental problems that could be caused by carbon capture. So scientists are still researching to further developed to help reduce the costs.

### Skills

#### Attention to detail
Again like in the first blog Attention to detail is important. When I reread my paragraphs I caught grammar mistakes like writing biodiversity ***biodiverstiy*** and needs to ***neeeds***. And after I finished writing everything I created a google doc and copy and pasted this whole blog onto it to check for grammar mistakes. I was thinking that there were none so I was suprised when I saw the red line and saw that I spelled technologies *techonolgies*, so I wouldn't have caught this grammar mistake if I didn't check with docs. when I clicked preview I noticed that I wrote *[a website] and (the link to the website)* and it didn't work. Then I saw that it was because I accidentally flipped the brackets and parentheses, so I flipped them and it fixed it.

### Context
In this blog I will be writing about how I brainstormed for future *technologies / innovations* and finalizing all my content so it is ready for my website. On a document I organized and finalized my content that is going to go on my website. 

### EDP/Content
I took all the things I *brainstormed* and started to organize the content. I wrote that my topic was **environment** and I gave context on it by explaining what the environment is and how I organized what I wrote. I chose to organize my content on **how accessible it is to everyone** and **keeping in mind why would people want to use it**. I finished all of the [brainstorming on the doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q_izQp8XaDOM2vZaT7W8zCd092ZBvzXC5lu-4rw8twg/edit) and I did write a little about planning some possible *solutions* or *improvements*. 

Something I was thinking about was having miniature **CCS** or **Carbon Capture and Storage** and they could be placed anywhere and they will absorb the *Carbon Dioxide in the air* and solidify it. Another possible future technology is just having better **biodegradable plastics**. Because the biogradable plastics today create microplastics which can cause pollution to the soil. There is a certain worm species called the **Galleria mellonella larvae** or **wax worm** that can eat plastic easily because of their saliva. Since we don't want to reproduce a ton of the worms, scientists are trying to replicate the saliva.

### Skills

#### Organization
Organization is a skill I improved when putting and organizing the things I wrote and researched about into a document.
#### Consideration
Consideration is another skill I improved on because I am considering how accessible these technologies are to the general population.
#### A bit of Creativity
Creativity is something I have a lot of, and seeing what others created made me draw a blank on new ideas and so I imagined futuristic innovations. Like the **CCS** because it was a somewhat recent technology that needs a lot of improvement, and only the rich can use it. And I wrote for the future that everyone can own a small version of it.

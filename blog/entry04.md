## Content
The tool I decided to pick and try out was **A-Frame**. I liked A-Frame because it teaches how to code with 3d. It also can be interactive which means that you can control, zoom out, and more. And also I chose A-Frame because there were images in the introduction and it looked like co-spaces. 

## How I tinkered with A-Frame
I tinkered with A-Frame by using **Jsbin**. Jsbin is used to test code and you can edit it with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript**. Jsbin doesn't save your code unless you copy the link on the top and it would have random letters which are yours.

First I went to the A-Frame website and went to the most recent introduction. There, it briefly talked about what A-Frame was and gave us starter code under it. So I copy and pasted the code to Jsbin. 

###### The code
```
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

I tinkered a lot and underneath is the product. I changed the background color, I added a second cube/box, and added more 3d shapes. On the [A-Frame Website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) on the left you can scroll down and under the primitives section is where I got the other 3d shapes.

```
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-box position="-1 2.0 -3" rotation="21 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-cone position="2 2.0 -3" rotation="21 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-cone>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF3D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#0000FF"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

The final result is [this](https://jsbin.com/gafucajuzo/edit?html,output).

## Sources
The source is [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). It is where I got the code and I brought and tinkered with the code on [Jsbin](https://jsbin.com).

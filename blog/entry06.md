# Entry 6
##### 5/1/24

## Content
In my [plan.md](https://github.com/robertx7476/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/plan.md), I made my MVP, the timeline, a few colors that I might be using, and putting in the wireframes and linking them.
My plan:

```
## Wireframes
* [Mobile](mobile.png)
* [Desktop](pc.png)

## Colors
* 99F4FB (a light blue color)
* 126693 (a darker blue)

## Timeline
4/15/24-4/21/24:
This week, I am going to do the wrireframe. And I will start coding.
4/22/24-4/28/24:
I will finish coding this week and add the components I choose.
4/29/24-5/1/24:
I will make sure everything is good and everything works properly.
#### MVP
My minimum viable product would be a basic website formatted the way based on the wireframe I created and having the content on the Website.
```

The hardest thing about making my MVP was thinking what to put in it. The easiest part of making the plan was the wireframes. There are two wireframes, the [mobile wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/m59a8U) and the [pc wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/7XUt37). Those wireframes I created before the plan so all I had to do was put the links in.

Then for the colors, I mostly wanted blue on my website so I put two different shades of blue. And I used the lighter blue on my website. I didn't put more colors because I wanted most of my website to be white.

For the timeline, it was a little trickier on deciding when to do and what to do. So in the end, I decided to make the timeline really simple for myself. Giving myself a week to put my content on the website and start coding. Then the next week finishing coding and adding whatever components I want, and then the last few days I will try to make sure everything is working properly.

## EDP
So for my Freedom Project, this is the MVP which stands for Minimum Viable Product. The stage I am in is testing out the product and seeing what I can improve. And since I am only at the MVP there are many things I can add to my website to make it better.

## Skills
<b>Logical reasoning/Embracing failure</b>
Since it's been a while, when I was doing this blog entry. I forgot how link words/sentences. So I keep trying and failing.

Example:

```
()[] <-- Linking it backwards
```

Then doing it correctly but thinking I did it wrong. Then I checked [previous blogs](https://github.com/robertx7476/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry05.md) and saw that I did do it correctly.

<b>Growth Mindset</b>
I continued to practice the growth mindset by perservering and doing the blog and not giving up halfway.

## Content
In my final blog entry, I will write about my presentation on my website in-class and in the expo and my takeaways from it.

When I was creating the **Elevator Pitch**, which is a shortened version of my presentation that will tell the audience about the most important parts of my website. I started writing the elevator pitch in my [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-MsKV1MKLts5nJ8mRCQfuX9r-b_HNz95qg7tRSHfS08/edit#heading=h.rl17k62yo3bm), I wrote a few bullets points on what is important to say and turned them into a paragraph that I mostly followed while presenting.

Before creating the *elevator pitch* and going to the *expo*, for the order of the [presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YOVOBsreBpK43SSlCpRxKOrqXLfCPasZZzG9V0K2yrw/edit#slide=id.g2dd89ad4a81_0_0) I choose three for the order of presenting and so I presented before the expo. Generally for my whole **Freedom Project** and presenting, I did well. I think I spoke clearly, I gave some eye contact to everyone, and I memorized almost everything. So I have a takeaway for presenting, before presenting I looked at everything and memorized what to say for everything except for my Part B. So when I was doing well in everything, when I got to speaking Part B, I froze because I didn't prepare for this part, so then I skipped it.

So in the future, I can't do everything by memory and I should have at least one bullet point for everything, because then I would have a general idea on what to say and won't pause and be awkwardly silent for a minute. Then another takeaway is finishing the work, because I did very well on this project but I didn't put my tool on my website. So that deducted some points on the expo and in-class presentation. I don't have a takeaway for the expo, because I spoke clearly and to a decent amount of students, saying my elevator pitch.
## EDP
**EDP** stands for **Engineering Design Process**. I finished following the EDP by making my website and sharing a presentation to everybody, informing them about my website and topic.
## Skills
### Consideration
A skill I used was **consideration** because most technologies have both pros and cons. Like most people see solar panels as only good, because they provide renewable energy so we don't have to burn fossil fuels, but creating solar panels causes pollution and if not disposed properly, the solar panel's metals are toxic and can make the environment toxic.
### Organization
Another skill is organization because I learned a lot researching for my freedom project so I needed to organize all the information.

        <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The environment is everything around us, both living and nonliving things, like nature and animals  to cities full of buildings. I wrote about existing inventions and technologies that can help the environment around us and help the earth as well suggesting future technologies. I organized my writing by writing about the accessibility of technologies and innovations that can be used everyday and about newer technologies.
            </p>
        <h3>Part A</h3>

        <b>Olio</b>
            <li>Is an app that is accessible to everyone.</li>
            <li>They distribute leftovers from local shops and businesses so it isn’t thrown into the trash which helps reduce food waste.</li>
        <b>Ecosia</b>
            <li>is an extension for Chrome and uses profits from ads to plant trees.</li>
            <li>A website said that during the Australian wildfires in 2020, Ecosia directed all of the search profits to plant trees there.</li>
            <li>And on their homepage it talked about it also.</li>
            <li>To help prove its credibility, they post monthly reports on where the money goes.</li>
            <li>The search engine has financed over 6 million trees.</li>
            <li>They also have 35+ countries involved, have 70+ active projects, and there are more than 20 million people using Ecosia.</li>
        <b>Eco-friendly batteries</b>
            <li>Lithium-ion batteries are bad for the environment, and are expensive.</li>
            <li>A company called Form Energy is working on a new type of battery called aqueous sulfur flow batteries.</li>
            <li>It will be eco-friendly batteries.</li>
            <li>Their cost will be cheaper, have larger storage, and create less pollution for the environment.</li>
        <b>Environmental sensors</b>
            <li>Scientists use them to identify and track the quality of air and water in the area.</li>
            <li>And they also use them to track acidification, identifying pollutants, and it captures data in real-time.</li>

        <b>Solar glass</b>
            <li>Has many benefits</li>
            <li>When the sunlight goes through the glass it generates electricity</li>
            <li>Which by putting on buildings like skyscrapers reduces pollution and is easier than solar panels.</li>
            <li>And they can also block harmful UV rays and it can help reflect heat.</li>
            <li>But also making solar glass causes pollution and getting the solar glass could be costly.</li>
        <b>Kinefox tracker
            <li>People would mostly use it to track their pets.</li>
            <li>But it is really useful for researchers and scientists who want to track animals in the wild.</li>
            <li>This technology was invented by Rasmus Worsoe Havmøller with his friends and colleagues.</li>
            <li>They made a tracker that uses the kinetic energy from the wearer’s movement and converts it to energy to recharge itself.</li>
<img src = "../prep/kinefox.png" class = "img-size"></img>
<li> This makes it easier for the scientists and for the animals that are being tracked.</li>
<li> Unless the tracker breaks, it can last an animal’s lifetime.</li>
<li> They added a low-power GPS tracker, and other technologies into the device and put it into a waterproof and fang-resistant case.</li>
<li> The tracking device and collar only weighs 5.3 ounces so small animals can wear it.</li>
<li> But there are limitations, they don’t work for nocturnal animals or animals that live in water.</li>
<li> And they don’t work in areas where it is hard to get sunlight.</li>

5.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS)
<li> It captures the carbon from the atmosphere.</li>
<li> The collected carbon will be transported and stored in the rock formations thousands of feet underground.</li>
<img src ="../prep/carbon.png" class = "img-size"><img>
<li> And it can create job opportunities in areas such as construction, maintenance, and engineering.</li>
<li> But it is really costly and isn’t really used today.</li>
<li> And needs to be improved to reduce environmental impacts.</li>
<li> Because there are environmental risks when injecting the carbon into rock formations.</li>

            <li>People would mostly use it to track their pets.</li>

            <li>This technology was invented by Rasmus Worsoe Havmøller with his friends and colleagues.</li>
            <li>They made a tracker that uses the kinetic energy from the wearer’s movement and converts it to energy to recharge itself.</li>
            <li> This makes it easier for the scientists and for the animals that are being tracked.</li>
            <li> Unless the tracker breaks, it can last an animal’s lifetime.</li>
            <li> They added a low-power GPS tracker, and other technologies into the device and put it into a waterproof and fang-resistant case.</li>
            <li> The tracking device and collar only weighs 5.3 ounces so small animals can wear it.</li>

## Timeline

This week, I am going to do the wrireframe. And I will start coding.

I will finish coding this week and add the components I choose.
4/29/24-5/1/24:
I will make sure everything is good and everything works properly.
#### MVP
My minimum viable product would be a basic website formatted the way based on the wireframe I created and having the content on the Website.
#### Beyond MVP

List:
- [] I am going to make my images interactive because I made the text interactive but forgot about the images.
- [] Make the navbar permanently on the page.
- [] Spacing the top of the freedom project better, the context and part a/existing is a little cramped.
- [] Then maybe adding another color or another shade of blue because everyone said that I needed another color.
- [] Changing the color of the context box so people can see it better.

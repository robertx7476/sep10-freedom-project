# Tool Learning Log
Tool: **Aframe**
3/25/24-4/1/24:
* In class:
    * Just read some more docs
        * Looked and put the lighting code in the [Jsbin](https://jsbin.com/becobeqico/edit?html,output).
        * Now the entities look shiny because of the light reflecting off of the shapes.
* At home:
    * Also I read that I could put some text in the scene.
        * And that I can change the size, position, font, and more of it.
    * And I put '<a-scene stats></a-scene>' in Jsbin, it actally put the statistics.
        * It tells you how much frames to takes, how long it takes for it to load, how many entities are in the scene, and more.
        * I deleted it from the code because it was blocking a ton of the screen.
    * Put some shadows in the code, I didn't see a difference.
    * I somewhat know what '<a-tetrahedron color="#FF926B" radius="5"></a-tetrahedron>' does, because there is a chart on the bottom showing how to change it's properties.
        * like color, height, scale, and metalness.

3/18/24-3/24/24:
* Started learning in Class
    * Just read the animation doc in class.
    * It connects with the basic scene I learned.
    * Testing the code out later in Jsbin.
* Later
    * Rereading the document on animation and following along on Jsbin.
    * Same [Jsbin](https://jsbin.com/becobeqico/edit?html,output) with the basic scene that I was tinkering with.
        * I first started with the first few lines of code on Jsbin.
        * As I was writing this down, I kept rechecking the code and sentences and realized, that some of code from the basic scene doc has animation.
            * So I deleted the previous sentence cause that wouldn't have made sense.
            * Also organized and spaced out the code better.
        * I somewhat understand material opacity, which I think was suppose to make the primitive more or less transparent, but then I read the thing and it said about properties and animate an arbitrary object.
            * No idea what arbitrary means.
                * Searched it up, it is something about chance.
        * Then there are other properties like to, dir, dur, delay, from, property, loop, and more.
        * Then after that it shows me that I can put multiple animations on an entity, I just need to put two underscores "__" in the naming.
        * Easing is next, and I think I remember last time when we did something for a project and there were five groups, actually four since no one did geometry but there was easing in the animation groups slides.
        * Also I put the animation where when the mouse hovers over the entity, it changes color from red to blue.

3/17/24:
* Today I learned more about my tool. On their website, I *read and tinkered* the code and text on how to build a basic scene.
    *  First I went along the document, reading and putting the code in [Jsbin](https://jsbin.com/becobeqico/edit?html,output).
    * I added the entites, changed the background color, changed the floor texture, and made a floor.
        * At one point, the background color was gradient with green and white.
    * And I learned how to start to animate the primitives.
        * In [Jsbin](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html), I tinkered on the positions of the primitives and where it gets to move.
        * I made the box move in the x, y, and z planes. Which means I can make them go up and down, left or right, and backwards and forwards.
        * And I can change the distance of the movement and how long it takes to get there and go back.
            * dur:1000 is 1 second.
3/10/24:
* I learned more about A-Frame by reading from their document.
    * I read the document about [3d models](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/models.html) and [entities](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/core/entity.html#example).
    * I learned a lot from reading the 3d model doc, like I can create, find, and animate 3d models. The document gives a list of places and programs on where to find 3d models and how to create them.
    * Though the entities document makes not that much sense to me. I partially understand that entities are placeholders for things, and that we can change their position, rotation, and scale. And that we can give it components, the components listed are geometry, material, and light components.

3/2/24:
* On *youtube* I searched **A-Frame tutorials** and I scrolled a bit then I found an interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3mNNZ356Ko). I learned a lot of things from the video + some stuff I know. In the beginning, the person has rotation and scale which I knew about, but for the numbers I am guessing that there are three for height, width, and length. They used color, primitives like boxes, and putting images in the website.
* I started to tinker on [Jsbin](https://jsbin.com/diyunidaco/edit?html,output) but it didn't work when I copied from the video. I think it is because the video was create on version 0.7.0 on A-Frame and now it is version 1.5.0 so stuff has changed, or because the images are needed to make the code function.
* And when I clicked the youtube channel, I saw another interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS8uGfd_oG8) where the youtuber created an interactable 3d world with 3d models. And I am exicted to learn how to put the 3d models in a website using A-Frame.

2/5/24:
* I am tinkering with Aframe. I copy and pasted the code into Jsbin and I changed the background color and the size of the shapes. And I learned how to change the color of the shapes.

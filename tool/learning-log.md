# Tool Learning Log
Tool: **Aframe**

3/10/24:
* I learned more about A-Frame by reading from their document.
    * I read the document about [3d models](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/models.html) and [entities](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/core/entity.html#example).
    * I learned a lot from reading the 3d model doc, like I can create, find, and animate 3d models. The document gives a list of places and programs on where to find 3d models and how to create them.
    * Though the entities document makes not that much sense to me. I partially understand that entities are placeholders for things, and that we can change their position, rotation, and scale. And that we can give it components, the components listed are geometry, material, and light components.

* On *youtube* I searched **A-Frame tutorials** and I scrolled a bit then I found an interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3mNNZ356Ko). I learned a lot of things from the video + some stuff I know. In the beginning, the person has rotation and scale which I knew about, but for the numbers I am guessing that there are three for height, width, and length. They used color, primitives like boxes, and putting images in the website.
* I started to tinker on [Jsbin](https://jsbin.com/diyunidaco/edit?html,output) but it didn't work when I copied from the video. I think it is because the video was create on version 0.7.0 on A-Frame and now it is version 1.5.0 so stuff has changed, or because the images are needed to make the code function.
* And when I clicked the youtube channel, I saw another interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS8uGfd_oG8) where the youtuber created an interactable 3d world with 3d models. And I am exicted to learn how to put the 3d models in a website using A-Frame.

* I am tinkering with Aframe. I copy and pasted the code into Jsbin and I changed the background color and the size of the shapes. And I learned how to change the color of the shapes.
